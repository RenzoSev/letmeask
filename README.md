## 🎨 Project 🎨
The current project was developed in the sixth edition of __NLW (Next Level Week)__ from [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
</br>
Basically it is an event that happens in the start of week until the final of week. 
You can select a "Technology Trail" to evolve your knowledege about the tech selected, for example: React Trail, React Native Trail, Elixir Trail etc.
</br>
Each day we receive a new video about the project. The projects and techs are chosen with the market demand in mind.
